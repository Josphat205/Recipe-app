<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [Recipe-App] <a name="about-project"></a>


**[Recipe-App]** The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes and  ingredients. It will allow you to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow you to make them public so anyone can access them.
